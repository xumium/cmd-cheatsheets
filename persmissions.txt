chown - a command to change a file's owner and group.
	Usage:	sudo chown <username>:<group> <path/to/filename>
		sudo chown -R <username>:<group> <path/to/dir>

chmod - a command to add or revoke permissions.
	Usage:	(sudo) chmod <Literal / Octal Permissions> <path/to/filename>
		(sudo) chmod -R <permissions> <path/to/dir>

sudo !! - run last command as root.

Literal Permissions:
       user   group    open
	u	g	o
       rwx     rwx     rwx

To add permissions:
<group>+<permession>
	(i.e. u+rw adds read and write at the user level.
	 To add permission globally, simply omit the level signifier (u/g/o)).

To remove permissions:
<group>-<permissions>
	same example as above only with the - sign.

Octal Permissions:

	7 rwx	3 -wx
	6 rw-	2 -w-
	5 r-x	1 --x
	4 r--	0 ---

To change permissions, simply type the octal number for each of the levels.
i.e. 777 grants rwx to all of the permission levels.

An easy way to remember this is to remember that 4 = r, 2 = w, and 1 = x.
In order to give the right permissions simply add the octals of the permission.
i.e. rwx = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7, r-x = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5, -wx = 0 + 2 + 1 = 3.
