Staging:

git add <filename>			- adds a file to the repo.

git add .				- adds all untracked files and changed to the 
staging area


Commiting:

git commit -m <message>			- commits all changes in the staging area to the 
project and lets you add a message directly.

git commit -a				- commits all changes of all tracked files without 
staging.


Reviewing:

git status				- review current project status.

git log					- logs all commits that were made to the branch.

git branch				- lists all branches in current repo.

git checkout				- checks out a branch or version of the project.

git diff <hash/branch> <hash/branch>	- diffs between 2 versions or branches.


Branching:

git branch <branch_name>		- adds a new branch to the project

git checkout -b <branch_name>		- same as above but also switches to the new branch.

git checkout <branch_name> <file_name> 	- copy file from one branch to the current branch.

git branch -D <branch_name>		- deletes the named branch.
